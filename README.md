# IMDB Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

## Problem Statement
Understanding user sentiment from text reviews is essential for businesses to evaluate customer feedback.
The objective of this project is to classify IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using Natural Language Processing techniques.

## Dataset
Publicly available IMDB movie review dataset containing labeled positive and negative reviews.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing (lowercasing, stopword removal, tokenization)
- Feature extraction using Bag-of-Words / TF-IDF
- Train-test split for evaluation
- Machine learning classification models
- Model performance evaluation using standard metrics

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

## Key Insights
- Proper text preprocessing significantly impacts sentiment classification performance
- TF-IDF effectively captures important textual features
- Accuracy alone is insufficient to judge sentiment models

## Limitations
- Does not capture sarcasm or context deeply
- Performance depends heavily on data quality
- Not suitable for production use without further tuning
